# University WhatsApp Ride-Share Group Chat Analysis
## Project Overview

This project aims to perform a comprehensive data analysis of a university WhatsApp ride-share group chat. Inspired by Tushar Nankani's WhatsApp Chat Data Analysis project, the goal is to uncover insights regarding message frequency, active days, top users, and popular places visited by students. Using Python libraries like pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and wordcloud, we perform in-depth analysis and data visualization.

## Technologies Used

* Python: Core language used for data analysis.
  
* pandas: For data manipulation and cleaning.
  
* matplotlib: For creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
  
* seaborn: For data visualization based on matplotlib.
  
* wordcloud: For generating word cloud images to visualize popular words.
  
* Jupyter Notebook: For interactive coding and documentation.


## Objectives

This project focuses on the following key objectives:

* Analyze the Overall Frequency of Messages in the group chat over a period of time.
  
* Identify the Most Active Days when the group is used the most.
  
* Find out the Number of Members Who Haven't Sent Any Messages in the group yet.
  
* Highlight the Top 10 Most Active Users in the group.
  
* Determine Active Periods (days, hours, and months) when the group is most utilized.
  
* Analyze Most Common Words and Phrases to gain insights into the ride-sharing activity.
  
* Identify the Most Frequent Locations mentioned in the chat.

## Data Analysis Workflow

Data Collection: Export the WhatsApp group chat data in .txt format.

Data Preprocessing: Clean the text data to remove unnecessary characters, symbols, and non-message lines.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): 
- Visualize message frequency over days, hours, and months.
- Identify user activity trends and top contributors.
- Use word clouds to extract popular words.

Result Interpretation: Generate insights based on the visualizations.

Report Findings: Summarize findings, trends, and conclusions in a final report.
